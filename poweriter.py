Week-2:Exercise-power iter
Write an iterative function iterPower(base, exp) that calculates the exponential base^exp by simply using successive multiplication. For example, iterPower(base, exp) should compute base^exp by multiplying base times itself exp times. Write such a function below.

This function should take in two values - base can be a float or an integer; exp will be an integer â‰¥ 0. It should return one numerical value. Your code must be iterative - use of the ** operator is not allowed.

#code
def iterPower(base, exp):

    base: int or float.
    exp: int >= 0
 
    returns: int or float, base^exp
    '''
    # Your code here
    temp = 1
    while exp > 0:
        temp *= base
        exp -= 1
    return temp
